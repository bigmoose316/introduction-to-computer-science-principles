# Lesson 1.2: Building Blocks

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

-   Name the categories of blocks in SNAP and describe what the blocks in each category do
-   Describe the function of several common SNAP blocks (see [lab](lab_12.md) for specific blocks)
-   Be able to use common blocks to build simple SNAP programs (see [lab](lab_12.md) for specific blocks)

## Materials/Preparation

-   [Lab 1.2](lab_12.md) handout (SNAP Scavenger Hunt) ([Download in Word](Unit 1 Word/Lab 1.2 SNAP Scavenger Hunt.docx)) ([Link to PDF](https://teals.sharepoint.com/curriculum/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?guestaccesstoken=rJmltydojDSzEXH6CgB09OBvQwgDwjL2DxKUsAS7w0c%3d&docid=0e369dea97ab041e38a1360b6013dae54))
-   Set up auto-repeat 5 min timer
-   Set up Do Now as discussion forum on schoology
-   Set up schoology assignment to turn in link for lab
-   Set up webpage for random pairs
-   Open lab doc

## Instructor's Notes

0.  Do Now: label the SNAP interface worksheet
    -   Announce stamp system
1.  Introductory discussion

    -   Review the basics of SNAP from the previous lesson
        -   Ensure that students can:
            -   Define "block" and "script" 
            -   Describe how to build a script (snapping blocks together)
            -   Explain how scripts are executed (one block at a time in order)
    -   Introduce the concept of block categories
        -   Ask students to consider why categories are helpful as opposed to having a simple list of blocks
    -   Read off the objectives for today

2.  Activity
    -   Read activity instructions. ["SNAP Scavenger Hunt"](lab_12.md)
    -   Assign students random partners.
    -   Project the lab so students can see what color the blocks are
    -   Set timer for 9:10am to allow time for debrief.
    -   Check and assign grades to students as they finish parts 1 and 2. Grade on effort and completion. Correctness will be checked during debrief.
    -   Students should turn in 1 project per partner for part 3. When turning in link, must mention partner's name.

3.  Debrief
    -   Project solutions for 1.1 and 2.1 and have students check their worksheets
        -   Invite students to ask questions if they got something wrong + they don't understand why
        -   Point out the color coding for each category
        -   Emphasize important details in some of the blocks listed in part 2, such as:
            -   the ![](think.png) block will leave the bubble on the stage until something else is thought
            -   the ![](gotox-y.png) and ![](glide.png) blocks require explicit x- and y-coordinates
        -   Solicit a few student responses for each category in part 2.2 before commenting yourself
            -   Try to guide the students to discuss with each other and settle on a description for each category with minimal instructor intervention
    -   Discuss one or two student solutions to each of the SNAP programming problems
        -   Either solicit volunteers or cold call
        -   Point out differences between student solutions and call attention to the fact that there is more than one way to solve a problem

## Accommodations/Differentiation

-   Colorblind students may not be able to identify the block colors, but can still recognize the organization of categories. Be sensitive to this, but no modifications are likely required.
-   Students that are struggling with the lab can be paired up and/or receive individual instructor attention to help them through the activity.
-   The bonus assignment (3.4) should be used for students who finish quickly, and can be a setup for the [Animation Project](project_1.md).
